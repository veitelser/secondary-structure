3634 tags of length 25: trying to correct the training sequences themselves
via exp(-H) tag-vote results in 96.874% accuracy.

6764 tags of length 25: same method gives 97.4855%.

Using "split" method for first set of 3634 tags gives 88.5693%

===========
Let's experiment with tag length.
Hypothesis: shorter tags -> easier to keep the same sequence.

Using 3475 tags of length 20
Vote -> 98.0595%

Using 3480 tags of lenth 30
Vote -> 95.2518%
